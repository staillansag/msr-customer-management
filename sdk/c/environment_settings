Add to the following environmental variables accordingly:

- Add your JDK library directory and the webmethods library directory to
  the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

- Add the webmethods client.jar and the generic java classes to the

If ones JDK directory was /usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2, ones machine was an i386, and 
ones webMethods directory was /usr/local/webmethods, the following environment
variables would be set accordingly:


LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib/i386:/usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib/i386/native_threads:/usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib/i386/classic:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/webmethods/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:.:/usr/local/webmethods/lib/client.jar:/usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib/rt.jar
