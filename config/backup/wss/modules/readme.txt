Software AG does not support the deployment of custom 
handlers or modules via placement of an Axis Module (*.mar)
file in either of the following directories:

IntegrationServer_InstallDirectory\config\wss\modules

Unexpected behavior that arises due to the manual deployment 
of mar files directly to this location is the responsibility 
of the user and will not be addressed by Software AG.
